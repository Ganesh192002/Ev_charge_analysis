EV Charging Analytics Project
=============================

A complete end-to-end data analytics solution for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure. This project integrates Python-based data generation, SQL-based relational modeling, and Power BI dashboarding to uncover insights into station utilization, vehicle behavior, and weather impact.

Project Overview
----------------
This repository showcases:
- Synthetic data generation using Python
- Relational schema design and SQL queries for EV charging sessions
- Interactive Power BI dashboard with KPIs and visual storytelling
- CSV outputs for peak hours, station performance, vehicle activity, and more

Tools & Technologies
--------------------
- Python: Data generation, cleaning, and export to CSV
- SQL: Schema creation, joins, and analytical queries
- Power BI: Dashboard design, slicers, KPI cards, and visuals
- Excel: Time formatting and preprocessing

Key Insights
------------
- Most Active Vehicles: Identified top 10 vehicles by session count
- Station Utilization: Ranked stations by usage and revenue
- Weather Impact: Quantified sessions during rainy conditions
- Energy Consumption: Highlighted top manufacturers by kWh usage
- Peak Hours: Visualized hourly demand trends across locations



Project Results
---------------
This dashboard revealed that EV charging demand peaks between 6 PM and 9 PM, with urban stations like Velachery leading in usage and revenue. Tata and Hyundai vehicles consumed the most energy, while rainy weather caused an 18% drop in session volume. These insights enable smarter infrastructure planning, targeted station deployment, and improved user experience.
